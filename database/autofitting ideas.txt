easy enough to have multiple autofit methods.


use topology?
	network aware. wont miss small sections ability to find sections linking points 
	but complexity


don't have pg_routing on kasheek

but made Djecstra's algorithm in plpgsql.


partitioned readings into adjacent lines in readings_geom
nearest node to start of readings lines
to nearest node to end of line.

cost as mean_vertex_dist(edge_geom,readings_geom)
	







inner join network to run_geom on distance
	geom_to_run_range numrange function of run chainage for geometry
	run_range_to_geom function


have sec,s_ch,e_ch
insert into section_changes

then filter.
	remove where makes metric worse?

	
mean_vertex_dist of lag to lead <lag to current



consider all nearby sections to readings and filter?
	might miss small sections
	vertices within threshold



give each vect cost score. mean distance to nearest geom of fit.
high for unfitted.
