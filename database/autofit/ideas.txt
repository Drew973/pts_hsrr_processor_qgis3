sec_geom,run_geom



ST_HausdorffDistance(run_geom,sec_geom):
	furthest distance from nearest point
	good for spotting slip roads.
	bad where end of run geom far from correct section (100m intervals...) 
	measure of maximum rather than average dissimilarity.
	using bounding boxes will limit maximum distance
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
insufficient difference in cost functions for simple filter.


	
	want to fit sequence of linestrings to minimize distance to
	sequence of geometries(point or 2 point linestring) with possible gaps. can easily split where gap.
	ie multilinestringM
	
		
	want to:
		penalise fitting to section miles away
			
		prevent same part of route being in multiple sections. ie no overlapping route chainage ranges.
		reading can be in multiple sections though
	
		penalise discontinuities where sections not connected.
	
		
		
	
	
	
	
		reward per reading = x-cost function
		cost = cost_function -x
	
	
		need rules for what part of route can come after other part.
		
		
		chainage at finite intervals can acts as node.
		node per interval.
		
		each node connected to all nodes with higher chainage by dummy.
		or next node by dummy.
		
		
		
		each edge has to be from 1st reading within buffer to last reading within buffer
		
	
	
		can break readings into smaller pieces only fitted to single sec.
	
		limited accuracy. 1m more than precise enough.
		
		
		can easily get parts of readings not near network.	


		shortest_path?
