add row dialog:



	sec
	reversed?
	xsp
	ch
	start_sec_ch
	end_sec_ch
	
	
	
shortcut to:
	select on layers. alt 0
	add row from selected (no dialog). alt 1
	add row
	add dummy
	
	
	
	
	
	sets values from selected features on display.
	
	
	
	
needing to add dummys is confusing pita.


better to use add end run chainage
