		<h4 id="section_changes table">section_changes table</h4>


		<p>The section_changes table contains the following columns</p>
		<ul>
		
		<li>sec:section label. Needs to be in <a href="network.html">network</a>. Empty string ('') where gap or not in network. </li>
		<li>reversed: if survey is in opposite direction to section.</li>
		<li>xsp</li>
		<li>run:needs to be in <a href="run_info.html">run_info</a>.</li>
		<li>ch:chainage where run enters section. </li>
		<li>note:note for user. Has no effect.</li>
		<li>start_sec_ch,end_sec_ch: Section chainages(in direction of section) where run enters/leaves section. Can be used to calculate section chainage.</li>
		<li>pk(not displayed):primary key.</li>
		<li>run(not displayed).</li>
		<li>pt:point geometry(not displayed).</li>
		</ul>


		<p><a href="readings.html">Readings</a> from ch to next ch are fit to sec,reversed,xsp. Altering the section_changes table (through any means) will update the fitted,resized and coverage tables. <p>
		<p>The fitting tab and menu contain tools for viewing and editing it.</p>

		
		<p>Manually add rows through fitting,add row...</p>
		<p>Drop rows by right clicking, delete selected rows. </p>

		
	<h4 id="autofit">Autofit</h4>
		<P>Autofit automatically creates the route for the selected run. It is likely to make mistakes where:<P>
		<ul>
		<li>The nearest section to a reading is not the correct one </li>
		<li>The gps is inaccurate </li>
		<li>The network is inaccurate </li>
		</ul>
		<P>Autofit does not work out xsp.</P>


	<h4 id="sec_ch">Section Chainage</h4>
		<p>Section chainage is usually calculated from the nearest point on the section to the reading.</p>
		<p>Where start_sec_ch and end_sec_ch are set and >0 section chainage is calculated by interpolating between these.<p>
		<p>This should be done where the nearest point of the section is not at the correct chainage.</p>
		<p>This is important where the GPS has lost signal and for small roundabouts (that readings are closer to wrong side of). </p>
